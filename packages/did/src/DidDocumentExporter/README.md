# DID Document exporter

The DID Document exporter provides the functionality needed to convert an instance of a generic `DidDocument` into a document that is compliant with the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). This component is required for the KILT plugin for the [DIF Universal Resolver](https://dev.uniresolver.io/).

For a list of examples and code snippets, please refer to our [official documentation](TODO:).
