# KILT DIDs

A KILT Decentralised Identifier (DID) is a string uniquely identifying each KILT user that allows them to create CTypes, issue/collect attestations, and create delegation hierarchies.
A DID can be thought of as a container of different keys that are all under the control of the same DID subject.

For more information about KILT DIDs, please visit our [official documentation](https://docs.kilt.io/docs/sdk/core-feature/did).
For more information about Decentralised Identifiers, please visit the latest version of the [official W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
