# Kilt DIDs

A KILT Decentralised Identifier (DID) is a string uniquely identifying each KILT user (see the [KILT DID documentation](https://kiltprotocol.github.io/docs/docs/sdk/core-feature/did)). A DID can be thought of as a container of different keys that are all under the control of the same DID subject (see the [DID Core spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) for more information).
