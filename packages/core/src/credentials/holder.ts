/**
 * Creates a Verifiable Presentation from one or more credentials and adds a proof for the purpose of holder authentication.
 * To that end, the presentation can be scoped to a specific transaction, timeframe, purpose, or verifier, by means of multiple mechanisms.
 *
 * @param credentials Array of one or more Verifiable Credentials to be included in the presentation.
 * @param holder Interfaces for interacting with the holder identity for the purpose of generating a presentation proof.
 * @param holder.did The Decentralized Identifier (DID) of the holder.
 * @param holder.didDocument The DID Document of the holder. If omitted, the holder DID will be resolved internally to retrieve the document.
 * @param holder.signers An array of signer interfaces, each allowing to request signatures made with a key associated with the holder DID Document.
 * The function will select the first signer that matches requirements around signature algorithm and relationship of the key to the DID as given by the DID Document.
 * @param presentationOptions Object holding optional arguments for scoping the presentation.
 * @param presentationOptions.validFrom A Date or date-time string indicating the earliest point in time where the presentation becomes valid.
 * Represented as `issuanceDate` on the presentation.
 * Defaults to `proofOptions.now`.
 * @param presentationOptions.validUntil A Date or date-time string indicating when the presentation is no longer valid.
 * Represented as `expirationDate` on the presentation.
 * @param presentationOptions.verifier Identifier (DID) of the verifier to prevent unauthorized re-use of the presentation.
 * @param proofOptions Object holding optional arguments for creating and scoping the presentation proof.
 * @param proofOptions.proofPurpose Controls the `proofPurpose` property and consequently which verificationMethods can be used for signing.
 * @param proofOptions.proofType Controls the type of proof to be created for the presentation.
 * Currently, this function only produces {@link DataIntegrity.PROOF_TYPE DataIntegrityProof} type proofs;
 * Any other values will be mapped to a known algorithm or cryptosuite for use with this proof type, thus allowing to control the signature algorithm to be used.
 * @param proofOptions.challenge A challenge supplied by a verifier in a challenge-response protocol, which allows verifiers to assure signature freshness, preventing unauthorized re-use.
 * @param proofOptions.domain A domain string to be included in the proof.
 * This plays a role similar to the `verifier` option, but is not restricted to DIDs.
 * This could, for example, be the domain of a web-application requesting credential presentation.
 * @param proofOptions.now Allows manipulating the current date and time for the purpose of presentation & proof generation.
 * Defaults to the current date and time.
 * @returns A holder-signed presentation.
