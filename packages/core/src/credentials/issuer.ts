/**
 * Creates a new credential document as a basis for issuing a credential.
 * This document can be shown to users as a preview or be extended with additional properties before moving on to the second step of credential issuance:
 * Adding a `proof` to the document using the {@link issue} function to make the credential verifiable.
 *
 * @param arguments Object holding all arguments for credential creation.
 * @param arguments.type A type string identifying the (sub-)type of Verifiable Credential to be created.
 * This is added to the `type` field on the credential and determines the `credentialSchema` as well.
 * Defaults to the type {@link KiltCredentialV1.CREDENTIAL_TYPE KiltCredentialV1} which, for the time being, is also the only type supported.
 * @param arguments.issuer The Decentralized Identifier (DID) of the identity acting as the authority issuing this credential.
 * @param arguments.subject The DID identifying the subject of the credential, about which `claims` are made.
 * Sets the `credentialSubject.id` property of the credential.
 * @param arguments.claims An object containing key-value pairs that represent claims made about the subject.
 * These key-value pairs are added to the `credentialSubject` property of the credential.
 * @param arguments.cType CTypes are special credential subtypes that are defined by a schema describing claims that may be made about the subject and are registered on the Kilt blockchain.
 * Each Kilt credential is based on exactly one of these subtypes. This argument is therefore mandatory and expects the schema definition of a CType.
 * @param arguments.cTypeDefinitions Some CTypes are themselves composed of definitions taken from other CTypes; in that case, these definitions need to be supplied here.
 * Alternatively, you can set a {@link CTypeLoader} function that takes care of fetching all required definitions.
 * @returns A (potentially only partial) credential that is yet to be finalized and made verifiable with a proof.

/**
 * Issues a Verifiable Credential from on the input document by attaching a proof. Edits to the document may be made depending on the proof type.
 *
 * @param credential A credential document as returned by {@link createCredential}.
 * @param issuer Interfaces for interacting with the issuer identity for the purpose of generating a proof.
 * @param issuer.did The Decentralized Identifier (DID) of the issuer.
 * @param issuer.didDocument The DID Document of the issuer. If omitted, the issuer DID will be resolved internally to retrieve the document.
 * @param issuer.signers An array of signer interfaces, each allowing to request signatures made with a key associated with the issuer DID Document.
 * The function will select the first signer that matches requirements around signature algorithm and relationship of the key to the DID as given by the DID Document.
 * @param issuer.submitterAccount Some proof types require making transactions to effect state changes on the KILT blockchain.
 * The blockchain account whose address is specified here will be used to cover all transaction fees and deposits due for this operation.
 * As transactions to the blockchain need to be signed, `signers` is expected to contain a signer interface where the `id` matches this address.
 * @param issuer.authorizeTx Optional. Allows customizing the way state changes on the KILT blockchain are authorized with a signature made with one of the issuer's DID keys.
 * @param issuer.submitTx Optional. Allows customizing the way transactions are signed by the submitter account and submitted to the KILT blockchain.
 * If you are using a service that helps you submit and pay for transactions, this is your point of integration to it.
 * @param proofOptions Options that control proof generation.
 * @param proofOptions.proofType The type of proof to be created.
 * Defaults to {@link KiltAttestationProofV1.PROOF_TYPE KiltAttestationProofV1} which, as of now, is the only type suppported.
 * @param proofOptions.proofPurpose Controls which relationship to the DID is expected of the key selected for creating the proof.
 * Defaults to `assertionMethod`, which is also the only value supported for {@link KiltAttestationProofV1.PROOF_TYPE KiltAttestationProofV1} proofs.
 * @param proofOptions.now Allows manipulating the current date and time for the purpose of proof generation.
 * As of now, this has no effect though.
