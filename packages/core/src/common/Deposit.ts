/**
 * Claims are a core building block of the KILT SDK. A claim represents **something an entity claims about itself**. Once created, a claim can be used to create a [[RequestForAttestation]].
 *
 * A claim object has:
 * * contents - among others, the pure content of a claim, for example `"isOver18": yes`;
 * * a [[CType]] that represents its data structure.
 *
 * A claim object's owner is (should be) the same entity as the claimer.
